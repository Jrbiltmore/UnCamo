# Lens Specifications for Evolved Epithelial Modulation Detection

This document provides detailed specifications for the lenses used in detecting evolved epithelial modulation. The lenses must be capable of capturing both infrared (IR) and visible spectrum images while preserving polarization properties. The specifications cover materials, coatings, and optical properties required to optimize image clarity and spectral accuracy.

## 1. IR-Transparent Lens Materials

The lenses used for capturing infrared images must be made from materials that are transparent in the IR wavelength range of 8-14 microns. The recommended materials are:

- **Germanium (Ge):** High refractive index and excellent transmissivity in the IR range.
- **Chalcogenide Glass:** Offers a broad IR transmission range and is ideal for multispectral imaging.

### Specifications for IR Lenses:
- **Wavelength Range:** 8-14 microns
- **Transmission Efficiency:** ≥ 90%
- **Refractive Index:** 4.0 (Germanium) at 10.6 microns
- **Coating:** Anti-reflective (AR) coating to minimize reflection and enhance IR transmission.

## 2. Polarization-Preserving Lens Coatings

To detect polarization differences in epithelial cells, the lenses must be coated with polarization-preserving materials. These coatings help maintain the integrity of the polarized light while minimizing distortion or reflection.

### Specifications for Polarization-Preserving Coatings:
- **Coating Type:** Multi-layer dielectric polarization coating
- **Wavelength Sensitivity:** 400-700nm (Visible Light)
- **Polarization Efficiency:** ≥ 98%
- **Polarization Ratio:** 1000:1
- **Durability:** Scratch-resistant and suitable for outdoor use in harsh environments.

## 3. Optical Properties for Visible Light Lenses

For capturing images in the visible spectrum, the lenses must offer high optical clarity and minimal chromatic aberration. The following optical properties are recommended for visible light lenses:

- **Material:** High-grade optical glass (e.g., BK7)
- **Focal Length:** 35mm-50mm (for standard imaging applications)
- **Field of View:** 45°-60°
- **Chromatic Aberration:** ≤ 0.01%

## 4. Anti-Reflective (AR) Coatings for Visible Light

To ensure high-quality images with minimal reflection and glare, the lenses used for visible light detection must be coated with advanced anti-reflective coatings. These coatings help reduce surface reflections and improve light transmission.

### Specifications for AR Coatings:
- **Coating Type:** Multi-layer anti-reflective coating (MgF2 or equivalent)
- **Reflection Reduction:** ≤ 0.5% for wavelengths 400-700nm
- **Durability:** Resistant to environmental wear, scratches, and moisture.
- **Transmission Efficiency:** ≥ 95% in the visible spectrum.

## 5. Dual-Spectrum Lens Design

To facilitate simultaneous detection of both infrared and visible light, dual-spectrum lenses can be used. These lenses are designed to capture images across both the IR and visible spectra without significant distortion or loss of signal.

### Specifications for Dual-Spectrum Lenses:
- **Material:** Germanium (IR) and BK7 (Visible)
- **Transmission Range:** 400nm-14 microns (combined visible and IR)
- **Coating:** Dual-purpose AR coating suitable for both visible and IR wavelengths.
- **Field of View:** 45°-60°
- **Focal Length:** 50mm-75mm (optimized for multispectral imaging)

## Conclusion

The lens specifications outlined in this document ensure that the equipment used for detecting evolved epithelial modulation is optimized for both infrared and visible light detection. By using the right materials, coatings, and optical properties, these lenses will enhance the clarity and accuracy of modulation detection across the spectral range.
